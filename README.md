## how to use



## Process



## Getting started

1. Setting up the name of your library
  * Open `webpack.config.js` file and change the value of `libraryName` variable.
  * Open `package.json` file and change the value of `main` property so it matches the name of your library.
2. Build your library
  * Run `npm install` to get the project's dependencies
  * Run `npm run build` to produce minified version of your library.
3. Development mode
  * Having all the dependencies installed run `npm run dev`. This command will generate an non-minified version of your library and will run a watcher so you get the compilation on file change.
4. Running the tests
  * Run `npm run test`

## Dev

* `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode
